International Bitterness Unit (IBU) Calculation
  
  IBU = W*U%*A%*1000/(V*Cg)
  
    W = weight of hop addition in grams
    U% = Utilization from table accounting for gravity and time
    A% = Alpha acid content of hops
    V = colume of batch in L
    Cg = Correction factor is 1 unless specific gravity (SG) > 1.050
    Cg = 1+(SG(boil)-1.050)/2

Specific Gravity Calculation

  SG = 1+S*Y/V
  
    S = mass of sugar added in lb
    Y = Yield of sugar in pt/lb/gal (this is specific to type of sugar added)
    V = Volume of liquid in gal
    
Alcohol by Volume (ABV) calculation

  ABV= 131.25*(OG-FG)
    OG = specific gravity of beer before fermentation
    FG = specific gravity of beer after fermentation
