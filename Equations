International Bitterness Unit (IBU) Calculation
  
  IBU = W*U%*A%*1000/(V)
  
    W = weight of hop addition in grams
    U% = Utilization from table accounting for gravity and time
    A% = Alpha acid content of hops
    V = colume of batch in L

Specific Gravity Calculation (needs work to find yield values)

  OG = 1+0.0074*W
  
    W = weight of Liquid Malt extract sugar addition (lb)
    
  FG = 1+ (OG-1)*0.26
    
Alcohol by Volume (ABV) calculation

  ABV= 131.25*(OG-FG)
    OG = specific gravity of beer before fermentation
    FG = specific gravity of beer after fermentation
