Project Title: brewbuddy

Team: Benjamin Breyfogle, Tyler Nevell, Maxwell Reynolds

Vision Statement: With the rise of the craft beer revolution more people are brewing beer at home than ever. Our focus is to provide a useful tool to empower the modern homebrewer to achieve quality, consistency, and efficiency.  brewbuddy is a simple, easy-to-use app to plan, track, and record your brewing every step of the way.

Motivation: We all enjoy beer and brewing is very interesting.  There is also a market for this product with craft beer on the rise.

We have created the first iteration of a home-brewing app that allows users to input or use a pre-defined boil process and track the progress of their brew. To test out the app, run it locally or visit https://brewbuddy-9c95f.firebaseapp.com/.
