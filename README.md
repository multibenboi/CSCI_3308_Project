## brewbuddy

Project Title: brewbuddy

Team: Benjamin Breyfogle, Tyler Nevell, Maxwell Reynolds

Vision Statement: With the rise of the craft beer revolution more people are brewing beer at home than ever. Our focus is to provide a useful tool to empower the modern homebrewer to achieve quality, consistency, and efficiency.  brewbuddy is a simple, easy-to-use app to plan, track, and record your brewing every step of the way.

Motivation: We all enjoy beer and brewing is very interesting.  There is also a market for this product with craft beer on the rise.

Risks to Project Completion:

	1. Not very familiar with swift or creating apps
	
	2. Have limited experience working together

Mitigation Stragegies:

	1. We will have to dive in and learn how to create an app.  This will likely include a lot of youtube tutorials, stackoverflow questions, and trial and error.
	
	2. We have already had success working together.  Being reliable and quick to communication is key. We do not forsee many personality conflicts.
	
Development Method: We will adapt the scrum development method to suit our development needs.  We will likely start without the ScrumMaster role assigned, as our team is small.  At the moment we are planning to meet weekly on Tuesdays at 1:00 pm and have a small sprint each week.  This will serve as the sprint planning meeting where we can create the sprint backlog.  As the final due date approaches we will likely meet more frequently to check in like a Scrum meeting.
